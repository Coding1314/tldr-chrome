# tldr-chrome
ðŸ“š A chrome extension for [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).

:construction: **[The Roadmap ](todo.md)**

(feel free to contribute :smile:)

## Notes

- Currently the stuff inside the popup inherits styles from the webpage and hence can look kind of funky at times
- Fonts don't work :cry:

## Loading Extension

- The extension is yet to be released to the chrome webstore.
- To load the extension, download the repository and open extension preferences in chrome (go to `chrome://extensions`). Click the box marked `developer mode` and click the button `load unpacked extension...` after which you can navigate to the project directory and load tldr chrome
